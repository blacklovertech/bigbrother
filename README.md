Exploits-Scripts Collection !!
Only For Educational Purpose !!

NOTE: This is only for research and educational purposes only, i have created this list of php web shells for infosec community to do research or make use of it for educational purpose. Please use it at your own risk. This list will be updated on daily basis as an index of web php shells for research.
A collection of PHP exploit scripts, found when investigating hacked servers. These are stored for educational purposes and to test fuzzers and vulnerability scanners. Feel free to contribute.

### Why do you put these online? They're dangerous!

Yes, obviously. Don't copy them and store them on your own server. These are scripts found on hacked systems, so they're used to exploit the server and abuse some kind of vulnerability.

They are indeed dangerous in themselves. But if anyone can exploit a server or CMS, they can upload far more dangerous tools than these PHP scripts.

### Prettyfied the obfuscated code

All obfuscated code has been run through the [PHP Formatter](http://beta.phpformatter.com/), [PHP Beautifier](http://phpbeautifier.com/) or [UnPHP](https://www.unphp.net/) for readability (whichever was online at that time).

========

This project covers various common scripts

Such as: asp, aspx, php, jsp, pl, py

Note: There is no guarantee whether there could be a backdoor in a shell, but I will never add a backdoor deliberately when uploading by myself
